# OpenBook testing UI

## How to install and run

Prerequisite is to have Meteor.js installed.

If you have node.js >= 14, then this will install Meteor:

```
npm install -g meteor
```

Otherwise you can:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```


Navigate terminal to this directory and run:

```
npm install
meteor
```
